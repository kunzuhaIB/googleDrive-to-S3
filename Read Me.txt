Description: This program has been developed in python to copy the files in Google Drive to AWS S3 bucket.
Requirements: To run this program, secrets need to be set in the OS environment variables, I will soon upload the steps in this repository later. Secondly, 
it needs an authentication and an authorization process to access from the Google Drive. Thirdly, it requires an already set AWS account and eventually an S3 bucket.
Please, make sure to get these requirements done before running the program. I forgot to note the youtube video links from where I took help to implement this program but 
I can assure that I have liked each an every video I watched to get this done. On my next work I will add the links first thing.

Note: This is a learning experience and it still requires lots of finishing and good programming practices. Suggestions are welcomed. Thanks!
